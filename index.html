        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up in Vietnam, food was everywhere. Street food culture was
          huge in my hometown of Saigon. Unfortunately, when I was young, I had
          no interest in food whatsoever. I was a very picky eater and would
          sometimes eat the same thing for weeks in a row.
          <br />
          <br />
          when I became a teenager in the US, there was a show I would often
          watch called Bizarre Foods With Andrew Zimmern. This show is what
          transformed me into the foodie that I am today. I found it really
          fascinating, the things that he would eat, and how adventurous he was
          with food. It pushed me to also try new things and made me discover
          that I actually did love so many foods out there... and that's how I
          became obsessed with food lol.
