        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up in Vietnam, food was everywhere. Street food culture was
          huge in my hometown of Saigon. Unfortunately, when I was young, I had
          no interest in food whatsoever. I was a very picky eater and would
          sometimes eat the same thing for weeks in a row.
          <br />
          <br />
          when I became a teenager in the US, there was a show I would often
          watch called Bizarre Foods With Andrew Zimmern. This show is what
          transformed me into the foodie that I am today. I found it really
          fascinating, the things that he would eat, and how adventurous he was
          with food. It pushed me to also try new things and made me discover
          that I actually did love so many foods out there... and that's how I
          became obsessed with food lol.
        </p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>
          I fell in love with video games in elementary school when they would
          let me play on <a href="https://www.coolmath.com/">coolmath.com</a>
          <br />
          The first game I was really addicted to was Runescape.
          <br />
          But the game that I became completely obsessed with for most of my
          life was Maplestory.
          <br />
          The game that I'm currently obsessed with now is Overwatch lol.

        <h2>Netflix</h2>
        <p>
          I'm ashamed to say that Netflix takes up a huge part of my life lol. I
          spend a lot of time watching random things. My favorite genre is
          horror, but I watch everything that's popular on Netflix. Video games
          can sometimes make me really angry and tilted lol so sometimes I love
          to just lay in bed and get lost in a different story in a different
          world, following different lives.
        </p>
